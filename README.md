# ScoreKeeper2 Android app

The Score Keeper app gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing football. It was written in Java and Android.

This is just a practice app for Google Developer Challenge Scholarship I received for the Android Basics path https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships.
