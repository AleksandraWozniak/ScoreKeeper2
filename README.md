# ScoreKeeper2 Android app

The Score Keeper app gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing football. It was written in Java and Android.

 This was the second task within the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship I received for the Android Basics path on Udacity https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships.
